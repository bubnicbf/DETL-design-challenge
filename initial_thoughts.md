# Initial thoughts

## Understand the source data: Before you start designing the ETL process, you need to understand the source data. This includes identifying the data types, formats, and structure, as well as any data quality issues or anomalies.

## Develop a data mapping strategy: Once you have a clear understanding of the source data, you can start developing a data mapping strategy. This involves identifying how the source data will be transformed to conform to the target data model (OMOP), including data type conversions, data aggregations, and data filtering.

## Use a scalable, reusable, and customizable code framework: To automate part of the ETL process, you can use a scalable, reusable, and customizable code framework. This can be achieved using tools like Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, and Apache NiFi, which are designed to handle large volumes of data and can be customized to suit your specific requirements.

## Retain manual aspects of the process: While automating part of the ETL process can improve efficiency, it's important to retain manual aspects of the process that require knowledge of complex coding syntax. This ensures that the ETL process is accurate and reliable, and can handle any data anomalies or edge cases.

## Implement ETL conventions across clinical research sharing networks: To ensure that the ETL process is consistent across different clinical research sharing networks, it's important to implement ETL conventions. This involves developing guidelines and standards for data extraction, transformation, and loading, as well as ensuring that all stakeholders are trained on these standards.

## Test and validate the ETL process: Once you have designed and implemented the ETL process, it's important to test and validate it. This involves running the ETL process on a subset of the data to ensure that it produces the desired results. Any issues or anomalies should be identified and addressed before the ETL process is deployed to production.

## Monitor and maintain the ETL process: Finally, it's important to monitor and maintain the ETL process to ensure that it continues to run smoothly. This involves setting up alerts and notifications to alert stakeholders to any issues or anomalies, as well as regularly reviewing the ETL process to identify areas for improvement.
